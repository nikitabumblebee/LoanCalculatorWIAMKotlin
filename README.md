Loan calculator on Kotlin

1) Clone repositoty
2) Select real device or simulator
3) Run application

You can change values for both sliders, change theme (dark/light), tap button to send application.
If you want to get error, you can change type of id in LoanResponse from Int to String. That would be an error with incorrect decoding.
